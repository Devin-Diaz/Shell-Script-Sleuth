# ShellScriptSleuth

## Introduction
**ShellScriptSleuth** is a specialized tool developed to parse and extract command-line entries from Unix shell logs efficiently. This utility addresses the real-world challenges faced by instructors and teaching assistants who review logged shell sessions to verify and understand student commands in operating systems courses.

## Motivation
My experience assisting students in an operating systems course highlighted the inefficiencies in navigating extensive shell script logs captured on the university's Unix server. These logs often include not only commands but also outputs and other terminal interactions. Reviewing these logs to extract relevant command inputs was both time-consuming and manually intensive. ShellScriptSleuth automates this process by specifically extracting only the command inputs, effectively eliminating the need to manually sift through outputs and system messages, and significantly reducing the manual effort involved.

## Outputs
**ShellScriptSleuth** provides clear and concise outputs, transforming verbose script logs into easily reviewable command entries. Below are examples of the outputs generated by ShellScriptSleuth:

### Raw Unix File
